## LI Resources ⭐
__Providing high-quality resources just for you.__ 🚀

Welcome to LI Resources discord server, a place where you can chat with our community and get the latest information (such as updates, releases, sales, etc.) regarding us. LI Resources stands for "**Lurvorx**'s *and* **IzzTeyy**'s **Resources**". Together we are a developer team developing FiveM resources to people seeking for high-quality resources.

We started as "rookies" a few years ago, didn't know anything about coding and just looked like a ❓ question mark. However, we slowly started to learn it and began to understand it more and more for everyday, which was really fun. All the years going forward and finally started to work together and creating **LI Resources** with love and sweat, euw.. 😄
